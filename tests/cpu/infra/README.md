# Infrastructure Invariants

These tests validate supporting components:

- Configuration dataclasses
- Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
- Rollout buffer correctness
- Action repeat (AR) and temporal action repeat (TAR)

These invariants ensure the training pipeline is robust and reproducible.
